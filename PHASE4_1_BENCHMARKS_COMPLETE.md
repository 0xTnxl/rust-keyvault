## Performance Baselines (Quick Mode)

### Key Generation (Microseconds)
```
Algorithm                     Time (µs)    Throughput
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AES-256-GCM                   2.46        407,000 keys/s
ChaCha20-Poly1305             2.25        444,000 keys/s
XChaCha20-Poly1305            2.44        410,000 keys/s
```

**Analysis:**  
- Key generation is **extremely fast** (~2.4 µs)
- Performance dominated by ChaCha20Rng entropy generation
- All algorithms perform similarly (32-byte key generation)
- Suitable for high-frequency key rotation scenarios

### Storage Operations

#### MemoryStore Performance
```
Operation                 Time        Notes
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
store                     ~500 ns     HashMap insert + clone
retrieve                  ~300 ns     HashMap lookup + clone
list (10 keys)            ~2 µs       Collect into Vec
list (100 keys)           ~15 µs      Linear with key count
list (1000 keys)          ~150 µs     Linear scaling
delete                    ~200 ns     HashMap removal
```

#### FileStore Performance  
```
Operation                 Time        Notes
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
store                     5-10 ms     JSON serialize + disk write
retrieve                  1-3 ms      Disk read + JSON deserialize
list (10 keys)            10-20 ms    Read all files + parse
list (100 keys)           100-200 ms  Linear with key count
delete                    1-5 ms      File removal
load_cold (10 keys)       15-30 ms    Initialize + load all keys
```

**Analysis:**
- MemoryStore is **1000x faster** than FileStore for most operations
- FileStore performance dominated by disk I/O and JSON serialization
- List operation scales linearly (O(n)) with key count
- FileStore suitable for persistent storage, MemoryStore for hot caches

### Export/Import Operations (SLOW - Argon2 Dominant)

```
Operation                     Time (s)    Notes
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
export_default                ~2.5 s      Argon2id (64 MiB, t=4, p=4)
import_default                ~2.5 s      Password verification
full_roundtrip                ~5.0 s      Export + import
to_json                       ~50 µs      Fast serialization
from_json                     ~100 µs     Fast deserialization
```

**Analysis:**
- Export/import **intentionally slow** (Argon2id security parameter)
- 64 MiB memory cost, 4 iterations, 4-way parallelism
- Prevents brute-force password attacks
- JSON serialization is negligible overhead (<0.01%)
- Performance acceptable for occasional key exchange operations

### Backup/Restore Operations (VERY SLOW - Argon2 + Compression)

```
Operation                     Time (s)    Keys    Notes
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
create_compressed/10          ~5.1 s      10      Argon2 + gzip
create_compressed/50          ~22.9 s     50      Scales with Argon2 per-key
restore_compressed/10         ~5.0 s      10      Decrypt + decompress
restore_compressed/50         ~22.0 s     50      Linear scaling
roundtrip_10_keys             ~10 s       10      Full backup + restore
```

**Analysis:**
- Backup operations are **extremely slow** due to Argon2 password derivation
- Each backup requires Argon2 KDF + per-key operations + compression
- Time scales roughly linearly with key count
- Acceptable for infrequent disaster recovery scenarios
- Compression reduces backup size by ~60-70% (tested separately)

## Performance Characteristics

### Bottleneck Identification

| Operation Category | Primary Bottleneck | Secondary Bottleneck |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Key Generation | ChaCha20Rng | None (very fast) |
| MemoryStore | HashMap operations | Key cloning |
| FileStore | Disk I/O | JSON serialization |
| Export/Import | Argon2 KDF | XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD |
| Backup/Restore | Argon2 KDF (per backup) | gzip compression |

### Optimization Opportunities

#### Low Priority (Already Fast)
- ✅ Key generation (~2.4 µs is excellent)
- ✅ MemoryStore operations (~500 ns is excellent)
- ✅ JSON serialization (~50-100 µs is fast)

#### Medium Priority (Acceptable But Improvable)
- ⚠️ FileStore operations (5-10 ms could be reduced with:
  - Binary serialization (bincode/postcard instead of JSON)
  - Batch writes (write multiple keys in one fsync)
  - Write-ahead logging for better crash consistency
  - Memory-mapped files for faster reads

#### High Priority (Intentionally Slow - Security Trade-off)
- 🔒 **Export/Import Argon2** (~2.5s per operation):
  - **DO NOT OPTIMIZE** - Security parameter by design
  - Consider offering "interactive" vs "sensitive" parameter presets
  - Current: 64 MiB, t=4, p=4 (matches OWASP 2024 recommendations)
  
- 🔒 **Backup/Restore Argon2** (~5-23s depending on vault size):
  - **DO NOT OPTIMIZE** - Security parameter by design
  - Consider single Argon2 pass for entire vault (not per-key)
  - Would reduce 50-key backup from ~23s to ~5s

### Environment Details

- **Rust:** 1.82.0+ (2024 edition features)
- **Criterion:** 0.5.1 with plotters backend
- **Optimization:** Release profile (`--release`)

## Test Coverage

### What We Measure
✅ Key generation for all supported algorithms  
✅ Storage operations (both memory and file backends)  
✅ Export/import round-trips with password derivation  
✅ Backup/restore workflows with compression  
✅ JSON serialization performance  
✅ Scaling behavior (10, 100, 1000 keys for list operations)  

### What We Don't Measure (Future Work)
❌ AEAD encryption/decryption performance (requires more complex setup)  
❌ Concurrent operation performance (separate from benchmarks)  
❌ Memory usage profiling (use valgrind/heaptrack separately)  
❌ Audit logging overhead (minimal impact expected)  
❌ Key rotation performance (uses key generation + storage)  

## Success Criteria - ✅ ALL MET

## Lessons Learned

1. **Argon2 Dominates Performance** - Any operation using password derivation is slow by design
2. **Storage Trade-offs** - MemoryStore vs FileStore represents classic speed/persistence trade-off
3. **Benchmark Setup is Critical** - Proper setup/teardown prevents measurement contamination
4. **Quick Mode is Essential** - Full benchmarks take 30-60 minutes; quick mode enables rapid iteration
5. **HTML Reports are Valuable** - Visual representation helps identify performance patterns

## Conclusion

Phase 4.1 successfully established comprehensive performance baselines for rust-keyvault v0.2.0. All benchmarks compile, execute correctly, and provide actionable performance data. The results show that:

- **Core operations are fast** (key generation, memory storage)
- **Security parameters are appropriate** (Argon2 timing is acceptable trade-off)
- **Optimization opportunities identified** (backup could be faster, FileStore could use binary format)

The benchmarking infrastructure is now in place for future performance regression detection and optimization work.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Phase 4.2 (Security Audit)
