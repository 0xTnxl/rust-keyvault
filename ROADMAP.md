## Phase 3: Production Features (Week 3) 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### Priority 1: Key Import/Export (2-3 days) ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Enable secure key exchange between vaults

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented and tested
- ✅ Export format: Versioned encrypted JSON with metadata
- ✅ `export_key()` with Argon2id password protection (64 MiB, t=4, p=4)
- ✅ `import_key()` with validation and audit logging
- ✅ XChaCha20Poly1305 key wrapping (24-byte nonces)
- ✅ Format versioning (EXPORT_FORMAT_VERSION = 1)
- ✅ Metadata validation on import (algorithm, version, expiry)
- ✅ JSON and binary serialization
- ✅ 4 unit tests + integration test (all passing)
- ✅ Working example: `examples/export_import.rs`

**Implementation Details**:
```rust
pub struct ExportedKey {
    pub format_version: u32,

- ✅ All keys and metadata included
- ✅ HMAC-SHA256 integrity checks
- ✅ Optional gzip compression (60-70% size reduction)
- ✅ Password-protected encryption (Argon2id + XChaCha20Poly1305)
- ✅ Format versioning for compatibility
- ✅ 5 unit tests + 1 integration test (all passing)
- ✅ Working example: `examples/backup_restore.rs`

**Implementation Details**:
```rust
pub struct BackupConfig {
    pub include_audit_logs: bool,
    pub compress: bool,

    pub encryption_algorithm: Algorithm,
    pub encrypted_data: Vec<u8>,
}

// FileStore methods
impl FileStore {
    pub fn backup(&self, password: &[u8], config: BackupConfig) -> Result<VaultBackup>;
    pub fn restore(backup: &VaultBackup, vault_path: &Path, password: &[u8]) -> Result<Self>;
}
```

**Tests Passing**:

### Priority 3: Key Usage Policies (2 days) ⏳ NEXT
**Goal**: Enforce constraints on key usage
- Incremental backup

### Priority 3: Key Usage Policies (2 days)
**Goal**: Enforce constraints on key usage

**Features**:
- [ ] Define `KeyPolicy` struct
- [ ] Add policy enforcement in encrypt/decrypt
- [ ] Support operation limits (max uses)
- [ ] Support time-based restrictions (not before/after)
- [ ] Support operation type restrictions (encrypt-only, decrypt-only)
- [ ] Add policy audit logging

**API Design**:
```rust
pub struct KeyPolicy {
    pub max_operations: Option<u64>,
    pub not_before: Option<SystemTime>,
    pub not_after: Option<SystemTime>,
    pub allowed_operations: Vec<KeyOperation>,
}

pub enum KeyOperation {
    Encrypt,
    Decrypt,
    Sign,
    Verify,
    Derive,
}

impl KeyMetadata {
    pub fn with_policy(mut self, policy: KeyPolicy) -> Self;
}
```

**Tests**:
- Policy enforcement on operations
- Expired policy rejection
- Operation count tracking
- Policy update tests

- ✅ Mixed read/write operations
- ✅ Stress test with 20 threads × 100 operations
- ✅ Deadlock detection test
- ✅ Concurrent FileStore operations
- ✅ Concurrent export/import operations
- ✅ 7 concurrency tests (all passing)

2. ✅ `test_memory_store_concurrent_writes` - Parallel writes without data races
3. ✅ `test_memory_store_mixed_operations` - Mixed read/write scenarios
4. ✅ `test_file_store_concurrent_operations` - FileStore thread safety
5. ✅ `test_memory_store_stress` - High-volume operations (2000 ops)
6. ✅ `test_no_deadlocks` - Complex sequences with timeout detection
7. ✅ `test_concurrent_export_import` - Parallel key exchange operations

**Thread Safety Verified**:
- MemoryStore RwLock provides safe concurrent access
- FileStore with Mutex<> serializes operations correctly
- No data corruption under concurrent load
- No deadlocks or race conditions detected
- Export/import operations are thread-safe
